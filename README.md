A program replicating the classic game of Mastermind.  Computer or player will choose a formation of black "pegs" ans white "pegs". Guesses will be made by the opposite player and feedback will be given each turn on how correct each peg color/placement is.  

This project further practices general logic/connecting methods, creating classes, and tying everything together.
