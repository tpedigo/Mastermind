A program replicating the classic game of Mastermind.  Computer or player will choose a formation of 4 "colored" pegs ("colors" represented by the numbers 1-6). Guesses will be made by the opposite player and feedback will be given each turn on how correct each peg color and placement is.  

This project further practices general logic/connecting methods, creating classes, and tying everything together.
